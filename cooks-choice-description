<p><b>BLADE</b></p>
<p>To assure our customers get the best knives available, all Rada blades are crafted from surgical-quality, T420 high-carbon stainless steel for a <strong>lifetime of durability</strong> then hollow ground for incredible sharpness. Designed with frequent use in mind, non-serrated, hollow-ground blades can be easily re-sharpened to achieve a like-new blade again and again. For easy at-home sharpening, check out Rada’s Quick Edge Knife Sharpener. Both pieces in this set can be sharpened.</p>

<p><b>HANDLE</b></p>
<p>This set has <strong>two handle options</strong>. The silver handle is made from permanently cast brushed aluminum and has a satin finish. The black handle is constructed from stainless steel resin. Both are incredibly durable and fit beautifully into any kitchen décor.</p>

<p><em>"I have been using Rada knives since 1966...the ones I recently purchased were for my youngest son who recently married, has a new baby, and I noticed that his knife supply was quite limited...SO, I said, "Judy, Rada Cutlery would be the best gift you could give him." I am amazed at how well my own purchases have lasted. You are one awesome company."</em></p>

<p>A dull knife is a dangerous knife! Keep your blades sharp. When Rada’s high-quality non-serrated blades need sharpening, there’s no need for a professional knife-sharpening service. You can do it yourself in a matter of seconds with the modest but oh-so incredibly effective <a href="/products/quick-edge-knife-sharpener">Quick Edge Knife Sharpener</a>.</p>
</li>
<li id="tab2">
<p>Rada recommends hand washing all fine cutlery. Hand washing prevents microscopic dings on a knife blade’s cutting edge, eliminates the harsh environment created by a dishwasher’s high temperatures and abrasive detergents that will negatively affect its handle, and ultimately extends the life of the knife.</p>
<p>While Rada’s black handle knives and utensils are more dishwasher tolerant than the silver handles, hand washing is still recommended.</p>
<p>It boils down to this: When knives last a lifetime like Rada Cutlery knives do, you want them to remain in tip-top condition so you can enjoy them for a lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li id="tab3">
<p>Since 1948, Rada Cutlery has been crafting knives that stand the test of time. The hand-sharpened, razor-sharp edge of the surgical-quality, T420 high-carbon stainless steel blade ensures that durability reaches our customers...for a lifetime of use.</p>
<p>Every one of our products is handcrafted in the heart of the USA, with materials only from America. Our strong heritage and Midwest values assure dependability you can believe in and sharp good looks you’ll be proud to have in your home.</p>
<p>Outstanding knives. Exceptional value. That’s the Rada way.</p>
